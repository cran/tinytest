version 1.1.0
- Tests are now run with 'pdf(file=tempfile())' as graphics device. This avoids
  writing 'Rplots.pdf' under the library directory when R CMD check is run.
- Side-effects tracking now includes file operations in the test directory or
  subdirectories thereof.
- build_install_test now accepts arguments 'side_effects', 'remove_side_effects'  
- expect_* functions gain argument 'info': a user-defined message that is
  printed in long output format.
- 'run_test_dir' now selects files with "^test.*\\.[rR]$", not "^test.*\\.[rR]" 
  (thanks to Dirk Eddelbuettel).
- Fixed 'diff' message for scalar comparisons in expect_equivalent,
  expect_equal, expect_identical: 'target' and 'current' were switched in
  message (thanks to GH user Billy34).
- 'setup_tinytest' now keeps formatting for DESCRIPTION files (thanks to
  Bart-Jan van Rossum).
- Fixed crash of 'build_install_test' when pkg was developed under directory
  with spaces (thanks to Bart-Jan van Rossum).
- Fixed issue where R CMD check would hang when packages use paralellization (GH #36)
  or certain Rcpp features (GH #37). Thanks to George G Vega Yon and Dirk Eddelbuettel.


version 1.0.0
- New argument 'side_effects' for test runners: monitor side effects while running tests.
- New function 'report_side_effects': toggle monitoring side-effects within test files.
- Run test files in parallel, for example: test_package("pkg", ncpu=2). (Thanks
  to Dirk Eddelbuettel for the suggestion).
- New function 'exit_file':  stop running a test file with an optional message.
- Other packages can now extend the package, see '?register_tinytest_extension'
  for the API (Thanks to Michel Lang for the suggestion)
- New function 'using' loads tinytest extension package.
- New function 'expect_null'
- Improved reporting for 'expect_true', 'expect_false'
- Improved reporting for expect_identical, expect_true, expect_equivalent
  in the case of scalar values.
- Added second vignette with real-life examples of tinytest tests.
- build_install_test gains argument 'color' and 'verbose'
- test_package returns result visibly in interactive sessions.
- Fixed path issue for build_install_test on Windows (thanks to Jan Wijffels)


version 0.9.6
- Fixed error caught on CRAN

version 0.9.5
- New function 'expect_message'.
- New functions 'all_pass', 'all_fail', 'any_pass', 'any_fail' for investigating
  'tinytests' objects.
- When `interactive()`, 'test_package' will not throw an error upon a failing
  test. Still throws an error when not `interactive()`. This makes it more
  usefull for interactive testing of installed packages.
- 'test_package()' now returns a 'tinytests' object.
- Better 'verbosity' while running test files (thanks to Dirk Eddelbuettel for
  discussions and feedback)
- Added 'test_silent'. Check for lack of errors or warnings (Thanks to Bryan
  Hanson for the suggestion, #14)
- Colored output is turned off automatically when the pkg is loaded
  in a "dumb" terminal. (Thanks to Dirk Eddelbeutel for the suggestion, #12).
- Improved documentation, including on how to skip tests on CRAN.
- Improved vignette layout (thanks to Dirk Eddelbuettel's suggestions and initial 
  PR #15 for geometry settings)
- Improved behavior of 'setup_tinytest()' when a 'Suggests' field is
  already present in DESCRIPTION
- Fix: toleracence was not passed to 'all.equal' by 'expect_equal' and 
  'expect_equivalent' (Thanks to An Chu #17)
- Fix 'expect_warning' and 'expect_error' would crash when run on the CLI.
  (Thanks to Bryan Hanson #13)
- Fix: method dispatch in packages defining S4 methods now works.
- Fix: 'setup' now adds 'tinytest' to 'Suggests:' rather then adding an
  extra 'Suggests' field in DESCRIPTION.
- Corrections in README and vignette, thanks to GH user 'salim-b' PR #18, #19
- Internal: simplified code for 'expect_warning' and 'expect_error' 
  (thanks to Lionel Henry for suggestions).

version 0.9.4
- New function 'setup_tinytest' that adds 'tinytest' infrastructure to a
  package source directory.
- Global settings set by 'options' and 'Sys.setenv' in a test file are
  automatically removed after running a test file. This improves independence
  between test files. This default can be overwritten, see Chapter 3 of the
  'Using tinytest' vignette.
- Test file sorting order can be controlled with 'lc_collate' option in test
  runners or by setting options(tt.collate) globally.
- More control over testing packages in 'R CMD check' with extra arguments
  to 'test_packages'.
- Improved call reporting in case of multiline test expressions (for example
  when many test expressions depend on an 'if' condition).
- Fix in 'expect_warning' and 'expect_error'. In some circumstances evaluation 
  argument 'current' evaluated in the wrong scope, resulting in unfound variables.

version 0.9.3 
- New function 'expect_identical'
- All functions of the form 'expect_lol' can now also be called as 'checkLol' 
  (similar to, but not the same as 'RUnit' syntax)
- Expect_* functions now have first argument 'current' and second argument 'target'
- Added 'summary' method for objects of class 'tinytests'
- Default test directory is now 'inst/tinytest'
- Fix: 'as.data.frame' crashed on tinytests object with all tests passing.

version 0.9.2
- Processed review by CRAN team member.
- Output coloring is now optional.
- Fixed issue so package works correctly with r-oldrel.

version 0.9.1
- Fixed a few CRAN warnings.

version 0.9.0
- Initial release.
