\arguments{
\item{current}{\code{[R object or expression]} Outcome or expression under scrutiny.}

\item{target}{\code{[R object or expression]} Expected outcome}

\item{tolerance}{\code{[numeric]} Test equality to machine rounding. Passed
to \code{\link[base]{all.equal} (tolerance)}}

\item{info}{\code{[character]} scalar. Optional user-defined message. Must
be a single character string. Multiline comments may be separated by
\code{"\\n"}.}

\item{...}{passed on to \code{\link{grepl}} (useful for e.g. \code{fixed=TRUE}).}

\item{quiet}{\code{[logical]} suppress output printed by the \code{current} 
expression (see examples)}

\item{class}{\code{[character]} For condition signals (error, warning, message)
the class from which the condition should inherit.}

\item{pattern}{\code{[character]} A regular expression to match the message.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link{tinytest}} object. A tinytest object is a
\code{logical} with attributes holding information about the
test that was run
}
\description{
Express expectations
}
\details{
\code{expect_equivalent} calls \code{expect_equal} with the extra
arguments \code{check.attributes=FALSE} and \code{use.names=FALSE}

\code{expect_silent} fails when an error or warning is thrown.

\code{expect_inherits} fails when \code{\link{inherits}(current,class)} returns \code{FALSE}

\code{expect_stdout} Expects that output is written to \code{stdout},
for example using \code{cat} or \code{print}. Use \code{pattern} to
specify a regular expression matching the output.
}
\note{
Each \code{expect_haha} function can also be called as \code{checkHaha}.
Although the interface is not entirely the same, it is expected that
this makes migration from the \code{RUnit} framework a little easier, for those
who wish to do so.
